# Minetest-multiplant

This is a Mod for Luanti, formerly known as Minetest.
It adds a Multiplant to the game.
Multiplants can grow on farmland and switch to any other plant or flower if grown. Don't harvest them! Just collect the items.
There is an option that Multiplants can grow on wet soil without planting (like weed from farming_redo).

Very usefull for UnterNull-Mod.
